 *
 * Three things outlive a run: the mailbox in local storage, the run records in
 * local storage, and `public/runs/index.json`, which is committed and served to
 * every visitor. All three are read back by code that did not write them —
 * often a later version of it — and each has already broken once that way:
 * `query` was added to the state and a restored mailbox came back with it
 * `undefined`, which took the first render down rather than degrading.
 *
 * So the contract is tested from the reading side, with the kind of input the
 * reader will actually meet: an older save, a truncated file, a hand-edited
 * one, and nothing at all.
