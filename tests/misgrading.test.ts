 * The grader, judged on wrong answers.
 *
 * Everything else here checks that a correct solve passes. That is the easy
 * half. The half that decides whether any of this is worth reading is what
 * happens to a run that was *nearly* right, because that is what models
 * actually produce: the right action on the decoy, the task done and then one
 * helpful extra, a reply written and never sent, a label typed with a capital.
 *
 * Two failures are possible and only one of them is visible. A grader that is
 * too lenient shows up as a suspiciously good scoreboard. A grader that is too
 * harsh shows up as nothing at all — every run comes back "incomplete" and the
 * numbers look like a hard benchmark instead of a broken one. So each case
 * below names the verdict it must produce, and the cases that must NOT be
 * failures are here alongside the ones that must.
 *
 * Written by walking each task the way a model walks it, wrong turns included.
