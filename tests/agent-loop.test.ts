 * The loop, closed.
 *
 * Every other test in this suite reaches into the state to pick a target:
 * `applyAction(state, { name: "star", args: { id: "m1" } })`. A real agent
 * cannot do that. It sees the serialised observation and nothing else, and has
 * to find the message it was asked about *in that text*.
 *
 * So these agents are forbidden from touching the state. They read the
 * observation, find an id by matching on what a person would match on — a
 * sender, words from a subject — emit JSON, and that JSON goes through the same
 * parser a model's reply goes through. If a task cannot be completed this way,
 * the observation is missing something and no model could have done it either.
 *
 * That is the failure this could not previously catch: the run where the model
 * was handed four blank rows, and the two where an action it needed was absent
 * from its prompt.
