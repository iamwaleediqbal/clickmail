 * The other tests in this suite drive the reducer along the routes a correct
 * solve takes. This one drives it along the rest: `not_spam` on a message in
 * the archive, `restore` on something that was never in the trash,
 * `delete_forever` from the inbox, `star` with no id, `open` with a number.
 *
 * A model will do all of these. It is what a model does on the turn it has
 * misread which folder it is in, and the environment's answer has to be a clean
 * refusal rather than a half-applied mutation or a thrown exception — a throw
 * ends a paid run, and a half-applied mutation continues it from a world nobody
 * described.
