/**
 * What gets committed into a public repository.
 *
 * `public/runs/` is pushed and served to every visitor, so it is worth checking
 * mechanically rather than by eye. Everything the gym contains is synthetic —
 * the seed mailbox uses `.example` addresses, which RFC 2606 reserves for
 * exactly this — but that is a property of the current fixtures, not a law.
 * Point the environment at real data one day and these are the tests that
 * notice before the push does.
