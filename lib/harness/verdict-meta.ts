/**
 * How each verdict is named, drawn and explained — in exactly one place.
 *
 * Three components had grown their own copies and drifted: the same outcome
 * appeared as "Both" in one, "Incomplete and overreached" in another, and
 * "Incomplete, and did more than it was asked" in a third. "Both" in isolation
 * is not a label at all — it names a relationship to two things the reader
 * cannot see from where they are standing.
 *
 * Every name here has to survive being read alone, with no column header and no
 * neighbouring row to give it context.
