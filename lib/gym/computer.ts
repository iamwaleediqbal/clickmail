/**
 * The computer-use action space.
 *
 * This is the one that is actually hard. The model receives a screenshot and
 * nothing else — no element ids, no serialised DOM, no list of what is on
 * screen — and has to answer with coordinates. Finding the star icon is the
 * task, not a step that has been done for it.
 *
 * The semantic space in `actions.ts` is deliberately kept alongside it as a
 * separate mode rather than deleted. `star(id)` measures whether a model can
 * decide what to do; `click(x, y)` measures whether it can also find where to
 * do it. Running the same task under both, graded by the same golden state, is
 * the only way to say which of the two a failure came from.

 * Several open grounding models were trained on a 0-1000 grid regardless of
 * image size. A few answer in fractions of the screen. Rejecting two of those

 * merely speaking a different dialect, so the harness reads the dialect off the
 * numbers and records which one it decided on — a guess that is written down is
 * reviewable; a guess that is silent is not.
 *
 * The rules, in order:
 *   fraction  both values sit in [0, 1] and at least one is not a whole number
 *   grid1000  a value overshoots the image but both stay within 1000
 *   pixels    anything else, which is also the documented contract
 *
 * (0, 0) and (1, 1) are whole numbers, so they stay pixels. A model aiming at
 * the very corner of the screen means the corner, not the whole screen.

Reply with exactly one JSON object and no other text:

{"thought": "what you see and what you are about to do", "action": {"name": "click", "args": {"x": 120, "y": 340}}}

Available actions:

Rules:
- Reply with the JSON object only. No preamble, no explanation around it.
- Keep "thought" under 25 words. A long thought can run out of output budget
  before the action is written, and a reply cut off mid-object is a wasted turn.
- You cannot see element names or ids. Read the screenshot.
- A click that lands on nothing is still a turn you have spent.
- To type into a field, click it first, then type. The list has a search box.
- The list scrolls. If what you want is not visible, scroll it or search.
- Do exactly what was asked and nothing more, then call finish. Extra changes count against you.`;
