          An agent is given a task in plain English and turned loose on a live mail
          application. By default it sees only a screenshot and answers with coordinates —
          the same leverage a person with a mouse has, and no more.

          Grading compares the mailbox it leaves behind against the one a correct solve
          produces, never the route it took: there are many correct routes, and a shorter one
          is not a failure. Doing everything asked <em>and one thing more</em> is a failure,
          and is reported as its own outcome rather than a pass.
