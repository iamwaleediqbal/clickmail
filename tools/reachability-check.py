"""
Check that the reachability guards actually fail when broken.

tests/reachable.test.ts cross-checks three layers that have drifted apart
repeatedly: the reducer, the interface, and the browser driver. These mutations
prove each assertion bites — one of them originally did not, because a
fixed-width source window bled into the next switch case and found an `open`
belonging to a different action.

    python3 tools/reachability-check.py

Every file is restored afterwards, including when a mutation fails.

# Restoring after the subprocess covers a mutation that fails. It does not cover

# back — a Ctrl-C, or a `timeout` wrapping the pre-push checks. That happened,
