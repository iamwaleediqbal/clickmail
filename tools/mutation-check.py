"""
Check that the spending guards actually fail when broken.

A passing test proves nothing on its own. Two assertions in
tests/free-only.test.ts passed while matching a substring that survived the very
bug they claimed to guard: /BUDGET_STATE/ still matches `const BUDGET_STATE =
""`, and /isPaidModel/ still matches `isPaidModelXX`. Both guards were decorative
until this script found them.

So each guard is verified by reintroducing the bug it exists for and confirming
the suite goes red. Run from the project root:

    python3 tools/mutation-check.py

Every file is restored afterwards, including when a mutation fails. Run it after
touching anything to do with model selection, budgets or price ceilings.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- safety net

# Restore on the way out, whatever the way out is.
#
# The per-case `finally` covers a mutation that fails. It does not cover the
# process being killed between writing the mutant and writing the original back
# — a Ctrl-C, or a `timeout` wrapping the pre-push checks. That happened, and it
# left `# MUTATED` sitting in a workflow file where the next commit would have
# taken it. A tool that edits source in place has to survive its own death.
