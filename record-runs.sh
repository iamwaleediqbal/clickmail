#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Record real runs, one task at a time, and write them into public/runs/.
#
# Nothing runs without you saying so. Each task shows you its instruction, waits
# for you to approve it, records it, then shows you the outcome and the quota it
# spent before offering the next one. You can stop after any task and keep
# everything recorded so far.
#
# Everything this produces is measured: a real Chromium, real clicks, real
# screenshots, a real model. If a model is unreachable the run is recorded as an
# infrastructure failure and stays unscored, because a transport failure is an
# absent measurement rather than a model that failed.
#
# It cannot spend credits. Every request carries a zero price ceiling that the
# provider enforces by refusing rather than billing, the model list rejects any
# model with any non-zero price in any field, a reply reporting a cost aborts the
# run, and the credit balance is compared before and after.
#
# Usage:
#   ./record-runs.sh                  offer every task in turn
#   ./record-runs.sh triage           just this one
#   ./record-runs.sh --all            no prompting, run everything
#   ./record-runs.sh --models         show the model chain, spend nothing
#   MODE=tool ./record-runs.sh        the semantic action space instead
#   MODE=both ./record-runs.sh        both spaces per task, for the comparison
#   MODEL=… ./record-runs.sh          a specific model instead of the free router
#
# Spending is opt-in and bounded. A paid model requires BUDGET as well, so
# choosing to spend and choosing how much are one decision:
#
#   BUDGET=0.50 MODEL=google/gemini-3.7-flash ./record-runs.sh
#
# The batch stops the moment the running total reaches the budget, mid-task if
# necessary. Without MODEL set to a paid id, nothing can cost anything: every
# request carries a zero price ceiling the provider enforces by refusing.
#
# Computer use needs a model that accepts images. The free router picks one; a
# text-only MODEL will simply not see the screenshots.
#
# Playwright is a development dependency only. It lives in runner/, which has
# its own manifest so the root install never sees it, and .vercelignore keeps it
# out of the deployment entirely.
#
# Written for bash 3.2, which is what macOS ships. No associative arrays, and
# no empty command lists in a case branch — `y|Y) ;;` parses on bash 5 and is a
# syntax error on 3.2, so every empty branch is an explicit `:` instead.
