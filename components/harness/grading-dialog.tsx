/**
 * The verdict as a control, not a column.
 *
 * Grading is what you check once and then stop looking at; the trajectory is
 * what you actually read. Giving them equal width meant the thing being studied
 * was squeezed into half a pane and truncated, while a two-line answer occupied
 * the other half permanently.
 *
 * So the verdict collapses to its outcome — a tick or a cross you can read
 * across the room — and the detail behind it opens on demand.
